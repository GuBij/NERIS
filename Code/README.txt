The code for the Lagrangian particle dispersion model is provided in the folder Code/C++:
The C++ code makes use of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) for the calculation of the hypergeometric function in the forest parameterization.
The make file generates several executables. If an executable needs to be generated, be aware that the right dependencies are included on line 33 in the make file.
For example, in order to compile the simDose executable, do the following:
1)	run 'mkdir include' in the run directory
2)	make sure to add the right dependencies on line 30, $(DEPS2)$ in this case
3)	run 'make dose'
The genMeteo executable is generated by adding the dependencies $(DEPS1)$ instead on line 30 and by running 'make meteo' in the third step.
The README file in the Data folder describes how the C++ code can be run.

The code for the Gaussian plume model for the dose rate simulation is provided in the folder Code/MATLAB/plumeModel:
-	the main file is simPlume.m 
-	the code can be run in parallel, each processor a different day, by using the script script.pbs
-	the parameters for the simulation set-up can be modified in the file params.m
The code needs to be run like simPlume('0405') if the date is the 4th of May, and the meteofile meteo0405.txt needs to be provided in the folder 'meteo/'.

Folder Code/MATLAB/forestProfile:
-	the conceptual drawing that explains the construction of the forest parameterization (fig. 3.2 p.49) is obtained by running the script plotForest.m
-	the comparisons of the wind speed predictions and Reynolds stresses (fig. 3.3 p.57) with measurements inside the forest are obtained by running the script solveUeqn.m
-	the pie chart that represents the frequency of the predicted stability classes (fig. 3.4 p.59) is obtained by running the script cmpAtmStab.m

Folder Code/MATLAB/doseAnalyseTools:
-	the Chang and Hanna statistics in Table 3.5 (p.61) and Table 3.6 (p.63) can be generated by the script modelPerformance.m 
-	the NMSE vs FB plot (fig. 3.5 (a) p.62) is generated by the script NMSE_FB_plot.m
-	the plot of the predicted vs the observed dose rates (fig. 3.5 (b) p.62) is generated by the script plotDoseData.m
-	the SI values in Table 3.7 (c) (p.64) are contained in the struct that is outputed by the function in the file SI.m
